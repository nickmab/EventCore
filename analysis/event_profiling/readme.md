## Profiling analysis

I was trying to break down latency of different parts of the event loop in this application to then try to optimise, but the initial analysis made it look as though the majority of time is taken calling from one function into another rather (even without a vtable involved) than within some of the calls and processing that I expected to be time consuming. 

Hmph.

Anyway, what we have here is some timing data generated by running 1000 loops every 5 millis of the EventProfiler app as at commit aa892ea2d1276d754adbc786da1c3823f6aec1ce.
